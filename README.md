## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Communication




This project focuses on the development of a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning system, where multiple agents (representing snakes) interact and learn within a shared environment. The agents utilize implicit communication through a dedicated channel, allowing them to be aware of each other's actions, without direct communication. This setup is aimed at exploring emergent strategies that arise when agents cooperate and compete within the same environment.

### Key Features and Approach:

- **Decentralized Model**: Each agent in the system operates independently, but with awareness of the other agents' actions through implicit communication. This setup allows the agents to learn from each otherâ€™s behaviors and adjust their strategies accordingly.
  
- **Deep Q-Learning**: The learning process for each agent is guided by Deep Q-Learning, a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm. Deep Q-Learning is used to map the state-action space, enabling each agent to make informed decisions based on its experiences.
  
- **Emergent Strategies**: The primary goal of this project is to observe which strategies emerge when the agents, through their learning process, adapt to a dynamic and competitive environment. The agents (snakes) will play against each other in a version of the Snake game, where their goal is to maximize their rewards by outmaneuvering and avoiding obstacles while growing longer.

- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: The agents (snakes) in the game are aware of each other's positions, which creates an environment where their actions influence one another. The challenge lies in how they adapt their strategies not only to the environment but also to the presence of other agents, leading to complex and potentially cooperative or competitive behaviors.

### Future Directions:

- **Emergent Strategy Analysis**: One of the primary goals is to see how the agents' strategies evolve over time. Will they form cooperative strategies, or will they develop competitive behaviors? This will provide valuable insights into multi-agent learning dynamics.

- **Model Improvements**: Future work may include exploring different models for centralized control or improving the communication channels for better coordination among agents.

### Theoretical Background:

For more in-depth theoretical insights into Deep Q-Learning, decentralized multi-agent systems, and reinforcement learning strategies, I have written an article in my own words explaining these concepts. I would be delighted if you took the time to read it!
